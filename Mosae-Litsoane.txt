Stretch Questions

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    display: flex; in HTML
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    Display block: <div>, <section>, <p> 
    Display inline: <a>, <br>
    Display inline-block: <img>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
    The box model is the basic layout on a page. Its a set of rules that define how element sizes are calculated as you add borders, padding and margins around the main content. 
    This can cause elements to overlap and not come out the way you desired. This is not very responsive when using on certain devices. 
    Solution: To fix this we can use the flex-box model. It is moore responsive as margins and paddings change around the content area.
